# Minimal email server 0.1

soapdictate uses this server to store the emails â€“ a barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).


### Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.


	$ npm install
	$ npm start


Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/), however you'll need PostgreSQL set up locally to run it 


### Deploying to Heroku

	
	git add .
	git commit -m "nice commit"
	git push heroku master
	heroku open
